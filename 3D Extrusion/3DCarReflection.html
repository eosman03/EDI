<h1> 3D Car Reflection </h1>
<p> <i> We created a 3D model and 3D print of a toy car to scale. The goal was to accurately represent the toy car. This is my reflection for the project.
</i> </p> 
<h4> <i> Eloise Osman </i> </h4>
<h3> Guidelines </h3>
 
<p> The guidelines were as follows:  
<ul> <li> Car designed as an intersection of three forms
 </li>
</ul>
<ul> <li> 
Design car in a 1:1 ratio

</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
Size accuracy ±1% 

</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
Design is exported as stl
</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
Orient model in Cura for 3D printing to minimize support material
</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
File is exported as a gcode
</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
Final design is shared out as an embedded STL on an HTML webpage
</li> </ul>

</p>

<h3> Steps  </h3> 

<p> The steps were as follows:  
<ul> <li> Engineering drawing: Measured dimensions of the real toy car and translated that into our drawings. We drew the profile, xy, yz, and xy drawings
 </li>
</ul>
<ul> <li> 
3D Modeling: Transferred the engineering drawing onto OnShape. Using extrusion tool, made the car 3D. Removed Negative Space with extrusion tool. Adding Fillets and Wheels, details and made the car more accurate

</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
Printing: Imported design into Cura. We cleaned the print, cutting off the raft and anything else that was not meant to be part of the design

</li> </ul>

<ul> <li>
CAD Drawing: Calculating margin of error, documenting dimensions and details 
</li> </ul>

</p>

<h3> Materials  </h3> 
<p>
<ul> <li> PLA
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<h3>Process  </h3> 
<p> First, we chose our toy car. Then, we made our engineering drawing, focusing on correct measurements and paying attention to details. After, we put these drawings into OnShape, and created the 3D shape on there. After this, we added fillets and wheels to add detail, in addition to being able to make it our own with designs. I added a number "10". Our final project was printed on the 3D printer using PLA. </p>

<h3> Setbacks and Solutions </h3> 
<p> One setback I faced was on OnShape. I struggled to fix the shape of my car once it was extruded when it was not the shape I was looking for. I overcame this challenge after I explored the website and learned more about how to use OnShape. Another setback I faced was with scaling my figure. I found this difficult, though once I measured my car again to make sure I was being precise enough, it was easier to be closer to the correct scale. </p>

<h3> 3D Model </h3>
<p> Using Modelo</p>
